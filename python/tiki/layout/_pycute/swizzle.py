Methods for layout swizzling

A swizzle permutes the offsets a layout produces, to spread accesses across
shared-memory banks. `F2` expresses one as a stride: because its `+` is XOR, an
`F2`-strided `Layout` is an ordinary layout that happens to XOR its coordinates
together, and so passes through the whole algebra. `Swizzle` is the same
transformation written as a plain function on integers, for inspecting an
existing offset pattern.

class F2(StrideScalar):
  """
  A stride scalar over the binary field: `+` is XOR and `*` is carry-less.

  An element of `F_2^m = (Z_{2^m}, XOR, .)`, whose bits are the coefficients of
  a polynomial over the two-element field. Both the `F2 * F2` and `F2 * int`
  products are carry-less, so an integer operand acts through its bits rather
  than its value; the two agree wherever schoolbook multiplication carries
  nowhere, as it does for a power-of-two operand.

  Adding a nonzero `int` is an error rather than a coercion, since mixing `Z`'s
  carrying addition into XOR is the hazard the separate type exists to prevent.

  Examples:
    F2(0b1010) + F2(0b1100) == F2(0b0110)
    3 * F2(0b1010)          == F2(0b11110)
    F2(0b11) * 0b11         == F2(0b101)     # carry-less, where 3 * 3 == 9 in Z
    F2(1) + 0               == F2(1)         # 0 is still the identity
    F2(1) + 1               -> TypeError

    Euclidean division in `F2`: the unique `(q, r)` satisfying

    where an `F2` value's bits are the coefficients of a polynomial over the
    two-element field and `deg(F2(v)) == v.bit_length() - 1`.

    `F2`'s `*` is a carry-less product, so this is polynomial long division
    rather than integer division: `divmod(F2(0b1011), 0b11) == (F2(0b110),
    F2(0b1))`, whereas `divmod(11, 3) == (3, 2)` in `Z`.

    Both results are `F2`. Keeping the quotient in `F2` is what lets `idx2crd`
    chain `divmod` across the modes of a shape and `crd2idx` recompose the
    result, with every step staying carry-less.

    Since `deg(r) < deg(other)` implies `r < other`, the remainder is always an
    in-bounds coordinate of an extent-`other` mode. When `other` is a power of
    two -- the only case in which the modes of an `F2` layout occupy disjoint
    bit-fields -- the split is exactly the pair of bit-fields, and the
